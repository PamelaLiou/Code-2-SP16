### Object Oriented Programming in p5.js!

Unlike other languages, in Javascript, basically almost everything is (or can be) an **object** - that is, a collection of properties - and remember functions can also be properties in their own way. However, Javascript is not "object-oriented" in the traditional sense!

Since Javascript doesn't handle objects the way we handle them in Java or other OOP-oriented languages, you might expect that we need to program in a different way than we ordinarily would. This is somewhat true. Creating an 'object' isn't like making an instance of a class anymore. However, we can create a version of a constructor for objects in Javascript instead of just creating individual objects. We do this with a function call.
