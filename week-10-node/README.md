we’ll be covering generative grammars, using a javascript library called Tracery. We’ll work on things together, but if anyone wants to look at resources ahead of time, they are available online (linked below). We’ll be integrating our grammars with Cheap Bots Done Quick, a twitterbot hosting service that uses Tracery. Everyone should be able to get a simple twitterbot running in class. Please take a look through other bots for inspiration, or just to get a good sense of what is possible.

If you’re interested in this type of work, I’ve attached a zip file of some longer-form generated literature below- feel free to download and read through a few. The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed is particularly interesting, as it is very early (1984!). There are also several works from the annual NaNoGenMo (the generative answer to NaNoWriMo, where one writes a 50k word novel in November), and some chapbooks (including my own).

Markov Chain generation
The algorithm analyzes a source text and stores all the variations of a sequence of n letters.
Text generation starts from a random 5-character sequence present in the table, then out of the possible resolutions it randomly picks the next symbol.

'hello ' -> [m,w,p] chooses 'm' (randomly)
'ello m' -> [a,a,a,o,o] chooses 'a' (randomly)
'llo ma' -> [m]
'lo mam' -> [a,b]
'o mama' -> [' ']
' mama ' -> [w,!]
'mama w'....

The result is text that sounds right but doesn’t make any sense.

Example Dissociated press

The most common and utilitarian use of Markov chain for text generation is type of Spam

because is sincere,
we become the friend who separates the screen,
